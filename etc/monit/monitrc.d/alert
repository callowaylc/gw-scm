## You can override this message format or parts of it, such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded at runtime. For example, to override the sender, use:
#
# set mail-format { from: monit@foo.bar }
#
#

# set external maiserver
set mailserver smtp.gmail.com port 587 username "726media.alert@gmail.com" password "fe5180zz" using tlsv1 with timeout 30 seconds

## You can set alert recipients whom will receive alerts if/when a 
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on 
## events by using a filter as in the second example below. 
#
set alert callowaylc@gmail.com                       # receive all alerts
set alert gwambia@yahoo.com


## Do not alert when Monit start,stop or perform a user initiated action
#set alert manager@foo.bar not on { instance, action }
